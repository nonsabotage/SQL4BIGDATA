課題発見と問題解決の手法に続いて, 検索エンジンの最適化をはじめ, 
レコメンドの作成や並び順の最適化など,　より発展的なデータ亜活用とあｒたな価値を創造する手法を
紹介します. 

# コネクションの設定

```{r setup, message=FALSE}

## load libs
libs <- c( "DBI", "RPostgreSQL",  "purrr", "dplyr", "yaml" )
for( lib in libs ) {
    library( lib, character.only=TRUE )  
} 

## connection db
config <-
  read_yaml("config.yaml") %>%
  update_list( drv =  ~  dbDriver(drv))

knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "con")
```

# 検索機能を評価

ユーザーが何を検索して, 何を得ているのか.

## NoMatch率


検索結果が0件の場合にはユーザーにマイナスの衣装を与えてしまう. 

### NoMatch率を集計

```{sql}
SELECT
  substring(stamp::text, 1, 10) AS dt
  , COUNT(1) AS search_count
  , SUM(CASE WHEN result_num = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_match_count
  , AVG(CASE WHEN result_num = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_match_rate
FROM 
  access_log
WHERE 
  action = 'search'
GROUP BY
  dt
;

```

### NoMatchワード

何を検索してNoMatchとなったのかを把握して, 
検索エンジンの辞書を編集したりする. 

```{sql}
WITH
search_keyword_stat AS (
  SELECT
    keyword
    , result_num
    , COUNT(1) AS search_count
    , 100. * COUNT(1) / COUNT(1) OVER() AS search_share
  FROM
    access_log
  WHERE
    action = 'search'
  GROUP BY
    keyword, result_num
)
SELECT
  keyword
  , search_count
  , search_share
  , 100. * search_count / SUM(search_count) OVER() AS no_match_share
FROM
  search_keyword_stat
WHERE
  result_num = 0
```


## 再検索率とそのワード

検索ワードを変更したということは, 
検索エンジンの改善に役立つヒントが含まれている. 

### 再検索率

ユーザーが検索した後に, クリックをせずにもう一度検索をした場合には, 
再検索が行われたことが考えられる. 


```{sql}
WITH
access_log_with_next_action AS (
  SELECT
    stamp
    , session
    , action
    , LEAD(action)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_action
  FROM
    access_log
)
SELECT
  substring(stamp::text, 1, 10) AS dt
  , COUNT(1) AS search_count
  , SUM(CASE WHEN next_action = 'search' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS retry_count
  , AVG(CASE WHEN next_action = 'search' THEN 1. ELSE 0. END) AS retry_rate
FROM
  access_log_with_next_action
WHERE
  action = 'search'
GROUP BY
  dt
ORDER BY
  dt
;
```

### 再検索ワード

再検索ワードを集計することでシノムニ辞書(同意義語辞書)を改善することが可能となる.

```{sql}
WITH
access_log_with_next_search AS (
  SELECT
    stamp
    , session
    , action
    , keyword
    , result_num
    , LEAD(action)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_action
    , LEAD(keyword)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_keyword
    , LEAD(result_num)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_result_num
  FROM
    access_log
)
SELECT
  keyword
  , result_num
  , COUNT(1) AS retry_count
  , next_keyword
  , next_result_num
FROM  
  access_log_with_next_search
WHERE
  action = 'search'
  AND next_action = 'search'
GROUP BY
  keyword, result_num, next_keyword, next_result_num
```


## 再検索ワードを分類

ユーザーが再検索するモチベーション. 

- NoMatch
- 検索結果の絞り込み
- 検索ワードの変更


### NoMatchからの変更

```{sql}
WITH
access_log_with_next_search AS (
  SELECT
    stamp
    , session
    , action
    , keyword
    , result_num
    , LEAD(action)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_action
    , LEAD(keyword)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_keyword
    , LEAD(result_num)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_result_num
  FROM
    access_log
)
SELECT
  keyword
  , result_num
  , COUNT(1) AS retry_count
  , next_keyword
  , next_result_num
FROM  
  access_log_with_next_search
WHERE
  action = 'search'
  AND next_action = 'search'
  AND result_num = 0
GROUP BY
  keyword, result_num, next_keyword, next_result_num
;
```


### 検索の絞り込み

`LIKE`で使うキーワードを動的に作り出すことで, 元の検索キーワードを含んでいる
検索キーワードがわかる. 

```{sql}
WITH
access_log_with_next_search AS (
  SELECT
    stamp
    , session
    , action
    , keyword
    , result_num
    , LEAD(action)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_action
    , LEAD(keyword)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_keyword
    , LEAD(result_num)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_result_num
  FROM
    access_log
)
SELECT
  keyword
  , result_num
  , COUNT(1) AS retry_count
  , next_keyword
  , next_result_num
FROM
  access_log_with_next_search
WHERE
  action ='search'
  AND next_action = 'search'
  AND next_keyword LIKE concat('%', keyword, '%')
GROUP BY 
  keyword, result_num, next_keyword, next_result_num
;
```

### 検索キーワードの変更

全く異なるキーワードで変更をする場合の話.


```{sql}
WITH
access_log_with_next_search AS (
  SELECT
    stamp
    , session
    , action
    , keyword
    , result_num
    , LEAD(action)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_action
    , LEAD(keyword)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_keyword
    , LEAD(result_num)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_result_num
  FROM
    access_log
)
SELECT
  keyword
  , result_num
  , COUNT(1) AS retry_count
  , next_keyword
  , next_result_num
FROM
  access_log_with_next_search
WHERE
  action = 'search'
  AND next_action = 'search'
  AND next_keyword NOT LIKE concat('%', keyword, '%')
GROUP BY
  keyword, result_num, next_keyword, next_result_num
;


```


## 検索離脱率とそのワード

検索の表示後にアクションを行っていない, つまり離脱をしたユーザーは
その検索結果に対して満足をしていないことが考えられる.


### 検索離脱数の集計

searchアクションの次のアクションがNULLを探す. 
 
 
```{sql}
WITH
access_log_with_next_action AS (
  SELECT
    stamp
    , session
    , action
    , keyword
    , result_num
    , LEAD(action)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_action
    , LEAD(keyword)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_keyword
    , LEAD(result_num)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_result_num
  FROM
    access_log
)
SELECT
  substring(stamp::text, 1, 10) AS dt
  , COUNT(1) AS search_count
  , SUM(CASE WHEN next_action IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS exit_count
  , AVG(CASE WHEN next_action IS NULL THEN 1. ELSE 0. END) AS exit_rate
FROM  
  access_log_with_next_action 
WHERE
  action = 'search'
GROUP BY
  dt
ORDER BY
  dt
;
```

### 検索離脱ワード

```{sql}
WITH
access_log_with_next_action AS (
  SELECT
    stamp
    , session
    , action
    , keyword
    , result_num
    , LEAD(action)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_action
    , LEAD(keyword)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_keyword
    , LEAD(result_num)
      OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY stamp ASC)
      AS next_result_num
  FROM
    access_log
)
SELECT
  keyword
  , COUNT(1) AS search_count
  , SUM(CASE WHEN next_action IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS exit_count
  , AVG(CASE WHEN next_action IS NULL THEN 1. ELSE 0. END) AS exit_rate
FROM
  access_log_with_next_action 
WHERE
  action = 'search'
GROUP BY
  keyword, result_num
HAVING
  SUM(CASE WHEN next_action IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0
;
```


## 検索結果の網羅性を指標化


### 再現率(ReCall)

再現率とはあるキーワードに対して用意された正解アイテムのうち, 何割の
アイテムを検索結果として返すことができたかを意味する. 

```{sql}
WITH
search_result_with_correct_items AS (
  SELECT
    COALESCE(r.keyword, c.keyword) AS keyword
    , r.rank
    , COALESCE(r.item, c.item) AS item
    , CASE WHEN c.item IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS correct
  FROM
    search_result AS r
    FULL OUTER JOIN
      correct_result AS c
      ON r.keyword = c.keyword
      AND r.item = c.item
)
, search_result_with_recall AS (
  SELECT
    *
    , SUM(correct)
      OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 100000) ASC
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cum_correct
    , CASE 
        WHEN rank IS NULL THEN 0.
        ELSE
          100. * SUM(correct)
            OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 100000) ASC 
              ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
            / SUM(correct) OVER(PARTITION BY keyword)
        END AS recall
  FROM  
    search_result_with_correct_items
)
SELECT * FROM search_result_with_recall ORDER BY keyword, rank;

```


### リコール率の集約


```{sql}
WITH
search_result_with_correct_items AS (
  SELECT
    COALESCE(r.keyword, c.keyword) AS keyword
    , r.rank
    , COALESCE(r.item, c.item) AS item
    , CASE WHEN c.item IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS correct
  FROM
    search_result AS r
    FULL OUTER JOIN
      correct_result AS c
      ON r.keyword = c.keyword
      AND r.item = c.item
)
, search_result_with_recall AS (
  SELECT
    *
    , SUM(correct)
      OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 100000) ASC
      ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cum_correct
    , CASE 
        WHEN rank IS NULL THEN 0.
        ELSE
          100. * SUM(correct)
            OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 100000) ASC 
              ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
            / SUM(correct) OVER(PARTITION BY keyword)
        END AS recall
  FROM  
    search_result_with_correct_items
)
, recall_over_rank_5 AS (
  SELECT
    keyword
    , rank
    , recall
    , ROW_NUMBER()
        OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 0) DESC)
        AS desc_number
  FROM
    search_result_with_recall
  WHERE
    COALESCE(rank, 0) <= 5
)
SELECT
  keyword
  , recall AS recall_at_5
FROM  
  recall_over_rank_5
WHERE   
  desc_number = 1
;
```


## 検索結果の妥当性を指標化

適合率は検索結果に含まれる結果が, 何割が正解か. 


### 適合率を用いた妥当性の評価

```{sql}
WITH
search_result_with_correct_items AS (
  SELECT
    COALESCE(r.keyword, c.keyword) AS keyword
    , r.rank
    , COALESCE(r.item, c.item) AS item
    , CASE WHEN c.item IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS correct
  FROM
    search_result AS r
    FULL OUTER JOIN
      correct_result AS c
      ON r.keyword = c.keyword
      AND r.item = c.item
)
, search_result_with_precision AS (
  SELECT *
  , SUM(correct)
    OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 10000) ASC
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cum_correct
  , CASE
    WHEN rank IS NULL THEN .0
    ELSE
      100. 
      * SUM(correct)
          OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 10000) ASC
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
          / COUNT(1) 
              OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 10000) ASC
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
    END AS precision
  FROM
    search_result_with_correct_items
)
SELECT * FROM search_result_with_precision ORDER BY keyword, rank;
```



## 検索結果の順位を考慮した指標

### MAP

Mean Average Precision とは
「それぞれの正解アイテムがランキング中に初めて登場した順位における適合率の平均」

```{sql}
WITH
search_result_with_correct_items AS (
  SELECT
    COALESCE(r.keyword, c.keyword) AS keyword
    , r.rank
    , COALESCE(r.item, c.item) AS item
    , CASE WHEN c.item IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS correct
  FROM
    search_result AS r
    FULL OUTER JOIN
      correct_result AS c
      ON r.keyword = c.keyword
      AND r.item = c.item
)
, search_result_with_precision AS (
  SELECT *
  , SUM(correct)
    OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 10000) ASC
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cum_correct
  , CASE
    WHEN rank IS NULL THEN .0
    ELSE
      100. 
      * SUM(correct)
          OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 10000) ASC
            ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
          / COUNT(1) 
              OVER(PARTITION BY keyword ORDER BY COALESCE(rank, 10000) ASC
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
    END AS precision
  FROM
    search_result_with_correct_items
)
, average_precision_for_keywords AS (
  SELECT
    keyword
    , AVG(precision) AS average_precision
  FROM
    search_result_with_precision
  WHERE
    correct = 1
  GROUP BY
    keyword
)
SELECT * FROM average_precision_for_keywords;

```

# データマイニング

本来はＲやＰｙｔｈｏｎを用いるが, 
ここではあえてＳＱＬで**アソシエーション**分析に取り組むことで
データマイニング手法の理解を進める.

```{sql}
SELECT * FROM purchase_detail_log LIMIT 10 ;
```


## アソシエーション分析

- 支持度
- 確信度・信頼度
- リフト

### 2種類の関連について

```{sql}
WITH
purchase_id_count AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT purchase_id) AS purchase_count
  FROM  purchase_detail_log
)
, purchase_detail_log_with_counts AS (
  SELECT
    d.purchase_id
    , p.purchase_count
    , d.product_id
    , COUNT(1) OVER(PARTITION BY d.product_id) AS product_count
  FROM
    purchase_detail_log AS d
    CROSS JOIN
      purchase_id_count AS p
)
SELECT 
  *
FROM
  purchase_detail_log_with_counts
ORDER BY
  product_id, purchase_id
;
```


```{sql}
WITH
purchase_id_count AS (
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT purchase_id) AS purchase_count
  FROM  purchase_detail_log
)
, purchase_detail_log_with_counts AS (
  SELECT
    d.purchase_id
    , p.purchase_count
    , d.product_id
    , COUNT(1) OVER(PARTITION BY d.product_id) AS product_count
  FROM
    purchase_detail_log AS d
    CROSS JOIN
      purchase_id_count AS p
)
, product_pair_with_stat AS (
  SELECT
    l1.product_id AS p1
    , l2.product_id AS p2 
    , l1.product_count AS p1_count
    , l2.product_count AS p2_count
    , COUNT(11) AS p1_p2_count
    , l1.purchase_count AS purchase_count
  FROM
    purchase_detail_log_with_counts AS l1
    INNER JOIN
      purchase_detail_log_with_counts AS l2
      ON l1.purchase_id = l2.purchase_id
  WHERE
    l1.product_id <> l2.product_id
  GROUP BY
    l1.product_id
    , l2.product_id
    , l1.product_count
    , l2.product_count
    , l1.purchase_count
)
SELECT
  p1
  , p2
  , 100. * p1_p2_count / purchase_count AS support
  , 100. * p1_p2_count / p1_count AS confidence
  ,  (100. * p1_p2_count / p1_count)
     / (100. * p2_count / purchase_count) AS lift
FROM
  product_pair_with_stat
ORDER BY
  p1, p2
;
```

もう疲れたのでやらない..
